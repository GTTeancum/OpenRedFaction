These are disassembly/decompiler findings, not a completed renderer or runtime
verification. Existing geometry verifiers cover the separate animation path.

## Entry and dispatch

`53ee90` is the mesh-instance render entry. It requires nonzero instance
byte90 and clear bit80000000 in instance word1c. Optional arguments update
instance vectors before dispatch; their meaning still needs verification.

Definition word8c selects the branch:

- 0: definition flags114 mask801 selects `53ef50 -> 516f70`; otherwise
  `53ef70 -> 516f50`. Both wrappers forward the instance and one argument.
  After either, positive definition word110 calls `53ef40 -> 516f90`.
- 1: `53ef90` uses `5404a0`, copies instance vertices from pointer80 into
  a stack record, and calls `516a00`. Its local vertex array is192 bytes;
  validate authored counts and original limits before porting this branch.
- Other values: no draw dispatch in this entry.

Do not infer that flag801 or word110 can be ignored in the ordinary path.
Export and trace516f50/516f70/516f90 next to identify renderer callbacks,
materials, clipping, submission and ownership requirements. The branch1
routine also calls517f00/517f20 conditionally; its state effects need tracing.

## Update and instance ownership

`54cce0` advances effect-instance time, handles loop/stop state, and calls
`53f050 -> 53f060` for each mesh. Mesh updates are distinct from render entry.
`54b0d0` allocates mesh instances at98-byte stride; definitions use124-byte
stride. `53cde0` starts active byte90 at zero, clears upper attachment flag
bits, allocates vertices*12 and faces*24 buffers, and retains the definition.
The C port must own persistent animated geometry/UV storage before live draw.

`53f060` clears byte90 outside the active interval. Verify activation and
persistence at the effect owner rather than assuming a successful sample alone
sets visible state. Geometry sampling currently returns NOT_FOUND for inactive
samples and does not own visibility state.

## Existing implementation boundary

Shared code covers owned mesh decoding, frame/key sampling, direct-parent and
cached skeletal-parent geometry, and UV sampling. It does not yet provide this
render entry, persistent effect draw ownership, virtual tag lookup, or native
XEMU VFX submission. Continue against these exact renderer entry points;
do not replace authored modes with a generic textured triangle demonstration.
